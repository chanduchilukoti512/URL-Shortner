# URL-Shortner
The URL Shortener is a web application that allows users to input long URLs and get shortened versions that are easier to share. The application uses a backend built with FastAPI, a Python framework, to generate a unique short URL for each long URL. Users can also visit the short URL, which will redirect them to the original long URL.
